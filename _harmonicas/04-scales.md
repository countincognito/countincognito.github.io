The basic layout of 12 consecutive [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) is what defines an [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) (i.e. the eight - [octa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octa-) \- white keys on the keyboard going from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)); and it is from these 12 [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) increments that [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) are defined.

[Scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) are basically strings of [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) (played consecutively) that begin on a specific note ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) for example) and finish on that same note one [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) up or down. There are many such [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) in music, each has a specific name that supposedly reflects its sound and/or structure.

## Chromatic Scale

The simplest of these is the [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale): this [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) consists of all the white and black [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) between two [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) of the same name. In order to play it, simply play all the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) between two [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)s, or two [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)s, or two [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29)s, etc. Looking at it from a different angle, a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) is defined by the increments in which the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) ascend, so you can play the [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) corresponding to any [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) just by playing all the keys between two [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) that are an [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) apart.

For example, if you start on [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) and go up (or down) in [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) until you reach the next [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) (i.e. play all the keys between them), then you have just played the [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) in [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29). If you start on the [Bb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29) and do the same you will play the [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) in [Bb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29). It is the same for all the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note): as long as the string of increments within an [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) is the same, then you can play the same [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) for any [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) you want. In the case of the [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) the increments are all [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone).

How about that? We've barely started and you already know how to play all 12 [chromatic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale): just start on any [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) you want and go up or down in [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone):

Looking at the [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) written above, and the keyboard picture again, we can see that it is the difference between the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) (i.e. the increments) that define the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale). Once that is known, we can play that particular [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) starting on **any** [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note).

This is how all other [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) are defined; some of which you have probably heard of:

## Major Scale

The [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) is defined as:

```
Generic Major Scale       t  t  st  t  t  t  st
```

t = [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone) = 2 x [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone)


So starting on [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) would go: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29), [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29), [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29), [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29). If you play it on a keyboard you will see that the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) sounds "happy" or "agreeable", and this is why the piano keyboard is designed as it is: in order to make it easier to play the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale). Please note that black keys do not occur between two keys that are only a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) apart, i.e. [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29) and [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29), since there are no more [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) to be played within a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) increment. The black keys are called [accidentals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_%28music%29) (the white keys are called [naturals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_%28music%29)), and are refered to as #s ([sharps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_%28music%29)) or bs ([flats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_%28music%29)). As you have probably already guessed, a [sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_%28music%29) is a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) higher than the white key is named after (e.g. [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29) is a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) higher than [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29)) and a [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_%28music%29) is a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) lower than the white key it is named after (e.g. [Gb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29) is a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) lower than [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)).

Since a black key is surrounded by two white keys, it always has two names: the more observent of you will have noticed that [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29) and [Gb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29) refer to the same [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note). Any [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) with the same [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28music%29) but different names are referred to as [enharmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic). It is also possible to refer to white keys as [sharps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_%28music%29) or [flats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_%28music%29) (e.g. [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29) can be called [Cb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29), and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) can be called [B#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29)) since the terms only refer to the difference in [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28music%29); however, this is rare in piano-playing, and I have **never** heard it used in harmonica-playing.

Now see if you can work out how to play the [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) in [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29). Just follow the rules, starting on [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29) and going up: [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone), [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone), [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone), [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone), [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone), [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone), [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone). You will see that this [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) also sounds happy or agreeable. Just remember that a [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone) is the same as going up **two** keys at once.

```
Major Scale in F#/Gb       F# G# A#  B  C# D# F  F#
Generic Major Scale          t  t  st  t  t  t st
```

t = [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone) = 2 x [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) 

![Keyboard](/assets/images/harmonicas/keyboard.png)

## Minor Scale

The other [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) you have probably heard of is the [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale): this one negates the [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) by sounding sad or melancholy. The [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) is defined as:

```
Generic Minor Scale       t  st  t  t  st  t  t
```

t = [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone) = 2 x [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone).

If you look carefully you will see that this is equivalent to taking the last two increments of the [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) and moving them to the front. So if you play: [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29), [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29), [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29), [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), then you have just played the [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) in [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29).

So you could play the same string of keys (i.e. all the **white** keys) and you could get two different sounds depending on which key you started on ([A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) or [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)). Clever, isn't it?

So, what have we looked at so far? Well, you now know the origins of modern music theory, the history of musical development, and you can now play 36 different Scales (12 each of [chromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale), [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) and [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale)).

Not bad for half an hour.
