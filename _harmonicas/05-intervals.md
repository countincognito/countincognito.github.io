An [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) is a measure of distance between two notes. The term distance (in this case) refers to musical distance (i.e. [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28music%29)). In order to properly identify an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) by name, we must know its [numerical size and quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29#Interval_number_and_quality).

## Numerical Size of Intervals

The _numerical size_ of an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) can be calculated by counting the number of [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) in it (including the first and last [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note)). For example, from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) to [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29) we form a 3rd ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-1, [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)-2, [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-3), from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) to [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29) we form a 7th ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-1, [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)-2, [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-3, [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29)-4, [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)-5, [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29)-6, [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29)-7). However, not all [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) of the same numerical size have the same name. For this we need to calculate the numerical size of the [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) by counting the exact number of [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) therein (remember that a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) is just the distance between any two keys - black or white - on a keyboard).

## Quality of Intervals

By using the keyboard again, we can see that [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) of the same numerical size can have a different number of [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone). For example, the 2nd between [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) and [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29) has two [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) (which, you will remember, is also called a [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone)), while the 2nd between [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) only has one [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone). The same thing happens when you look at other [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29): For example, the 3rd between [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29) and [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) has three [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) (or one and a half [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone)), while the 3rd between [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) and [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) has four [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) (or 2 [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone)). This is why we also need to know the quality of an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) before we can know its full name.

| 12 | | | | | | | [Augmented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_seventh) | [Perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) |

(Note: only [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-[F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) and [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29)-[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) are [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_second) 2nds when comparing [naturals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_%28music%29))

## Compound and Simple

This bit is easy: _simple intervals_ are smaller than one [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave), _compound intervals_ are bigger than one [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) .

## Melodic and Harmonic

This bit is also easy: an [harmonic interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony) has both [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) played simultaneously (i.e. together at the same time), a [melodic interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody) has both notes played in succession (i.e. one after the other).

## Chromatic and Diatonic Semitones

A [chromatic semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_semitone) defines the distance between two [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) that are a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) apart but share the same name (e.g. [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29)-[Bb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29)), a [diatonic semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_semitone) defines the distance between two [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) that are a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) apart and have different names (e.g. [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)).
