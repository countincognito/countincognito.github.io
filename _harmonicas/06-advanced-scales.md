## Structure of a Scale

The standard tuning system with which most people are familiar (the one that is used on any piano) is known as [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament). According to this system of tuning, the distance between [octaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) is equally divided into twelve consecutive [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note). The technical definition of a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) is simply a series of [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) selected from these twelve, so theoretically there is an infinite number of possible [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale).

Each one of the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) from a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) is known as a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)); each [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) of a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) has its own name but is often refered to by a Roman Numeral. For example, the standard [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) consists of the [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)): I, II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII. These labels are merely used to define the relationship between the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) of a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale); as such, the eighth note of a [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) is refered to as [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) I since the eighth [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) is the same as the first, apart from the fact that it is an [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) higher.

Any two [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) can be distinguished by two things:

1. The number of [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) that they have in them (i.e. the number of [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) they have)
1. The distance between their [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music))

For example, you can build seven different [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) using just the seven [natural notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_%28music%29) (the white keys on a keyboard), all you need to do is change the [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) that you start on for each [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale). Since there are seven different [natural notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_%28music%29), there are seven different possible starting points, hence seven different possible [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale). The [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) has [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) separating [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) III-IV and VII-I (remember that the eighth note of a [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) is refered to as I).

## Relative Scales

[Relative scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key) are two different [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) that share the same [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note). For example, the [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) and the [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) contain the same [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note). They are both [relative scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key): [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) is the [relative major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_major) of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), and [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) is the [relative minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_minor) of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29). The [relative minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_minor) of a [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) is the same as the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) VI of the [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), and the [relative major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_major) of a [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) is the same as the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) III of the [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale).

## More about the Minor Scale

You may not like to hear this, but there are (in fact) **three** different types of [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale). All three have different [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) VI and VII:

1. [Natural minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale): this is the one we've already looked at, and it consists of the same notes as its [relative major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_major). Hence the name _natural_.
1. [Harmonic minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale): [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) VII is raised to form an augmented second between Degrees VI and VII. It also puts a distance of a semi-tone between [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) VII-I. This forms a [dominant chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_chord) or [dominant 7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord#The_dominant_seventh) on the fifth [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) of the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) (these new terms are explained below).
1. [Melodic minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Melodic_minor_scale): [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) VI is raised along with [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) VII to avoid the [augmented second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_second) formed in the [harmonic minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale).

## Other Names for Scale Degrees

These are the names of the [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) mentioned earlier:

Degrees and their Names

| [Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) | Name |
|-|
| I | [Tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music)) |
| II | [Supertonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertonic) |
| III | [Mediant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediant) |
| IV | [Subdominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdominant) |
| V | [Dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_(music)) |
| VI | [Submediant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submediant) |
| VII | [Leading Tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading-tone) or [Subtonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtonic) |

## Musical Modes

[Musical modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_modes) refer to [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) when applied to specific [diatonic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale); the most widely known are the [Gregorian modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_mode), which are themselves part of a very old style of musical theory that eventually evolved into the [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) and [minor scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) during the Renaissance.

You don't really need to know that much about [musical modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_modes) in order to play the harmonica. However, after being largely forgotten for many years they made a comeback in Classical music and Jazz music; as such, variants of [Gregorian modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_mode) are still used in modern Jazz. The use of these modes has lent itself to harmonica theory, and many of the [Gregorian modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_mode) often appear in name; these include: the [Dorian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_mode), the [Phrygian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_mode), the [Lydian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_mode), the [Mixolydian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixolydian_mode). Other modes that appear in harmonica theory include: the [Aeolian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_mode), the [Locrian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locrian_mode), and the [Ionian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_mode).

Like all types of [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale), each of the [musical modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_modes) has their own type of character; for example, the [Phrygian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_mode) (also called the _Third Gregorian mode_) is still used strongly in Andalusian music (Spain) and has [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) separating [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)) I-II and V-VI.

All these terms will be expanded upon when we cover [harmonica positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) in a [later section]({% link _harmonicas/11-harmonica-positions.md %}).
