Hopefully by now you have got a good idea of what [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) are. However, they are much more than just an interesting ways of putting [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) into an order: [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) form the basis of all music. The character of a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) can be used to mould the features of a piece of music; hence, a tune in a [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) will be sad or melancholic, while a tune in a [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) is likely to be upbeat or bouncy.

At this point, you are probably wondering what I mean when I say "in a [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale)"? Basically, it means that the tune in question is written and played using only (or mainly) the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) present in a particular [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale). So if I were to say that a tune is "in [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale)", it means that it only consists of the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) in the [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) (and maybe a few different ones here and there for musical colour), i.e. [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29), [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29), [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29), [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29). The [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) is like the musical alphabet of a tune; because the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) is like the foundation of a tune, it is the main source of character and style for the music.

Amongst all this talk about [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale), you may have noticed that the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) in the [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) are the same as the notes in the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale). The question that immediately springs to mind is: "How can two tunes, that are made up of the same notes, sound different?" The answer to this is all down to [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)).

[Chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) usually form the background [harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony) of tunes: in piano-playing, [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) (and their derivatives) are usually played with the left hand, and the [melody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody) is usually played with the right hand. The result is that the [melody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody) is blended in with the [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) that correspond to the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) of the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)) in which the tune is written. As such, a tune written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) will usually include a [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) constructed of [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) taken from the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), and this will emphasize the character of the tune. The simplest [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord) is [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29), and [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) all played at the same time. If you were to play this [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) on a keyboard, you would see that it is typical of the [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), i.e. it sounds "happy" or "agreeable". With [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) like this being played, along with the [melody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody), a tune will easily sound upbeat and is unlikely to accidently sound like a tune written in [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale).

This is all general detail, but it must be understood that [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) are ribs and spine of any music. They are so important in harmonica playing that they form the basis of where the individual [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) are physically positioned on a harmonica.
