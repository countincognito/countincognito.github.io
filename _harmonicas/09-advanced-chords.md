Three or more [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) played at the same time form a [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)). A [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) consisting of exactly three [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) is called a [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29), which are typically made by combining two or more 3rds. For example, the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-[E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) form the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord) or [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_triad). The [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) upon which the [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) is founded (i.e. essentially the one the [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) is named after) is called the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28chord%29) of the [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)); so in the [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-[E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) would be the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28chord%29). The other [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) of a [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) are named after the [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) they form relative to the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28chord%29) (e.g. 3rd, 5th, etc.).

## Triads

As always, there is a little more to understand regarding [triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29). There are four different types:

* [Augmented Triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_triad)
  * Consists of a [major 3rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_third) and an [augmented 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_fifth)
* [Major Triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_triad)
  * Consists of a [major 3rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_third) and a [perfect 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth)
* [Minor Triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_triad)
  * Consists of a [minor 3rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_third) and a [perfect 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth)
* [Diminished Triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_triad)
  * Consists of a [minor 3rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_third) and a [diminished 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_fifth)

The [major triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_triad) and [minor triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_triad) are considered to be _perfect_ since they contain a [perfect 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth). [Diminished triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_triad) and [augmented triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_triad) are named after the 5th that they contain, respectively.

## Inversions

A [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) is described as being in its [root position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_position) when its [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28chord%29) is the lowest [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) played. A three-[note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) (a [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29)) can also be played in its [first inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inversion) or [second inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inversion). A [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) is in its [first inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inversion) when its 3rd (i.e. the second [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note); the [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29) in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-[E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)) is the lowest [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) played. A [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) is in its [second inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inversion) when its 5th (i.e. the third [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note); the [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-[E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)) is the lowest [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) played. Naturally, the more [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) a [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) has the more Inversions there are to play.

Forming Triads in Major and Minor Scales

| [Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) | [Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) | [Natural Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale) | [Harmonic Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale) | [Melodic Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Melodic_minor_scale) |
|-|
| I | Major | Minor | Minor | Minor |
| II | Minor | Diminished | Diminished | Minor |
| III | Minor | Major | Augmented | Augmented |
| IV | Major | Minor | Minor | Major |
| V | Major | Minor | Major | Major |
| VI | Minor | Major | Major | Diminished |
| VII | Diminished | Major | Diminished | Diminished |

## 7th Chords

Many people have heard of [7th chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord), particularly if you ever played guitar, but very few actually know what they are. Essentially, if you add another 3rd to any [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)), you get a [7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord). It is called such because a 7th [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) is formed in relation to the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28chord%29), and a [7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord) can be built on any [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) of a [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) or [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale). There are five different named types of [7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord), which are defined by the [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) and the 7th [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29) forming the [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)):

* [Major 7th Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_seventh_chord)
  * Consists of a [major triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_triad) and a [major 7th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_seventh)
  * So called because both the [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) and 7th are [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_%28music%29)
* [Dominant 7th Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_seventh_chord)
  * Consists of a [major triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_triad) and a [minor 7th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh)
  * So called because the [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) is built on the [dominant degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_%28music%29) of the [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale) and [melodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Melodic_minor_scale) [minor scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale)
* [Minor 7th Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh_chord)
  * Consists of a [minor triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_triad) and a [minor 7th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh)
  * So called because both the [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) and 7th are [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_%28music%29)
* [Half-diminished 7th Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-diminished_seventh_chord)
  * Consists of a [diminished triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_triad) and a [minor 7th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh)
  * So called because the [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) is [diminished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_%28music%29), but the 7th is [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_%28music%29), so it is not completely [diminished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_%28music%29)
* [Diminished 7th Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh_chord)
  * Consists of a [diminished triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_triad) and a [diminished 7th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh)
  * So called because both the [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29) and 7th are [diminished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_%28music%29)

We could list all the [7th chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord), how they are formed and on which [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) of the [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) and [minor scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale); but, frankly, there is no point because it gets so complicated that we start listing [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) that don't even have names. That is a pretty good indication that we have covered enough.
