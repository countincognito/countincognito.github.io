As I mentioned before, [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) can be regarded as the ribs and spine of harmonica playing, or any form of music for that matter. However, like any skeleton, the individual bones are not much use unless their put together in the right order and in the right place. The same is true for the musical skeleton.

## Chord Structures

Just as certain [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) sound good together when they are played as [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29), certain [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) can be combined to form a [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure). A [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure) is basically a series of [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) played in a certain order, with each [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) played for a certain period of time; and that is basically it. Just as [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) can be considered the musical alphabet, so to can [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) be considered the words and [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure) the phases or sentences. Putting this all together we can see how different words can convey different meanings, just like [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord) or [minor chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_chord) create different sounds. When put together into sentences these can deliver complete messages designed to provoke thoughts or feelings.

For example, consider the phrase:

> Fair is foul, and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy air.

Now, you may not know where that phrase came from, who said it, and to whom, but you can hazard a guess that it is not particularly pleasant. The words "foul" "fog" and "filthy" are not exactly going to inspire you to wrap Christmas presents. Even the word "fair" slotted in occasionally does not seem to improve the idea behind it. Now, if the same words were thrown together in a totally random order (for example, "Hover foul, and the foul air fog is and filthy fair through is fair.") the effect would not be nearly as powerful. You might get a rough idea of what was going on in the background, but you it would hardly sound as scary. The same is true for music: by combining all the elements together in a way that is understandable and makes sense you can tell stories, throw tantrums, or confess love by making noises on a small, tinny instrument. Incidentally, it was the witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth casting a curse at the beginning of the play. Charming.

There are many different types of [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure). Some styles of music, such as [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues), have just a single, main [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure), whereas others like Rock, Pop, and Jazz can have any number of different [chord structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure) ranging from several to several hundred.

## Twelve-Bar Blues Chord Structure

The [Twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) is the bedrock of [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues) music. It is the foundation that one builds on, the basic script that begins "Once upon a time..." and finishes with "... happily ever after." From the [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure) you can work out how it starts and ends, and all you need to do is jazz up the story-line with a few interesting [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29). Just like several hundred swear words, a couple of car chases, and the odd debate about birth control can turn an otherwise boring Tarantino script into something just about bearable.

Now, the [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) is by no means the only [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure) used in [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues), but it is the most popular and (thankfully) probably the easiest to learn. It also appears frequently in a lot of Rock, Jazz and Country music. If you want to learn how to play the [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues) anywhere with anyone, then you will need to learn the [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues). No question.

Before we continue, I should clear up one or two things you may not be so familiar with: The word [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) refers to a set number of [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28music%29) within a piece of music; usually three or four [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28music%29) of time. If you have ever seen a piece of written music, you will have noticed the vertical lines dividing the horizontal strips where the musical [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) are written. These lines represent the end of a previous [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) and the beginning of the next. They are often used as guides to split music up into smaller pieces; much in the same way that a written paragraph is divided into sentences and phrases. They help musicians keep their [rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm) (the regular pacing beat to which music is played), which makes music easier and more pleasurable to hear. This is important because (going back to the analogy with written language) if you can imagine how an orator, actor or politician sounds when they give a stirring monologue (the good ones at least), they often try to keep their speach patterns fluid and regular; this makes their words easier to follow and understand. Try imagining how effective such speeches would be if the speaker decided to speed up and slow down at random; not only would they be less effective, they would sound completely ridiculous.

Usually, a single [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) is divided into four [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28music%29); so a [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) would be 12 x 4 = 48 [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28music%29). This twelve-bar structure is usually repeated three or four times, and each repeat is called a [verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_%28music%29). You can think of [verses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_%28music%29) as being like chapters in a book: each part of the same story, but different plots, characters and situations. The [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) usually has just three [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29), and these [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) always have the same relationship to each other: they are [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) formed on [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) I, IV, and V of a [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale). They are also refered to as the [tonic chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_chord), [subdominant chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdominant_chord) and [dominant chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_chord). These three [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) can be either [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord), [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_chord) or [7th chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord), depending on the type of character you want your music to have.

## Twelve-Bar Blues in G

It may seem surprising when I tell you that, when using a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica, the easiest [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) to play is in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29). I will explain why this is later on when we discuss [harmonica positions]({% link _harmonicas/11-harmonica-positions.md %}), but for the moment suffice it to say that the reason is because the three [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) needed for a [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) in [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) (namely [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) and [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)) are all conveniently located on the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica.

![C Harmonica](/assets/images/harmonicas/c_harmonica.png)

Looking at the layout of the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica once again, you may recall from the section on [harmonica history]({% link _harmonicas/08-harmonica-history.md %}) that blowing into any three holes in a row will produce the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord) ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29)-[E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)); drawing on holes 1, 2 and 3 will produce the [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) [major chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord) [second inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inversion) ([D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)-[G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)-[B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29)); drawing on holes 2, 3 and 4 will produce the [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) [major chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord) [root position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_position) ([G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)-[B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29)-[D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)); and drawing on holes 4, 5 and 6 will produce the [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29) [minor chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_chord) ([D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)-[F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29)-[A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29)). If you delve a little deeper you will notice that drawing on holes 2, 3, 4 and 5 will produce a [dominant 7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_seventh_chord) in [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) ([G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29)-[B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29)-[D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29)-[F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29)). This is really good news because pretty much any [7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord) is guaranteed to sound Bluesy. Remember that the [dominant 7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_seventh_chord) is formed on the [dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_%28music%29) [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) (V) of a [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale) or [melodic minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Melodic_minor_scale). In the case of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale)/[minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale), the [dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_%28music%29) [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) is [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29). If we look at the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) within each [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) and [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), we can see how the [dominant 7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_seventh_chord) in [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) is formed by notes [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29), [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29) and [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29).

Notes of the Major and Minor C Scales

| [Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | I |
|-|
| [Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) | C | D | E | F | G | A | B | C |
| [Natural Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale) | C | D | Eb | F | G | Ab | Bb | C |
| [Harmonic Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale) | C | D | Eb | F | G | Ab | B | C |
| [Melodic Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Melodic_minor_scale) | C | D | Eb | F | G | A | B | C |

It becomes clear that all the [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) contain the notes [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29), [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29) and [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29), except the [natural minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale) in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) which has a [flattened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_%28music%29) [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29) (and so can form a [dominant 7th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_seventh_chord)). Incidently, drawing on hole 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 together produces a [major dominant 9th chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_chord), but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

It seems amazing that so much versatility is contained within one small, tinny sounding instrument. But there you have it: a multitude of [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) available for adding colour, style and character to music, all perfectly located for playing the [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues).

## Chord Structure

So finally we are going to get down to the actual [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure). Sorry it took so long, but hopefully you will be wiser for the longer route.

Twelve Bar Blues in G

| Chord | Total Beats | Number of Bars | Degree Names |
|-|
| [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) | 16 | 4 | I ([Tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29)) |
| [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) | 8 | 2 | IV ([Subdominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdominant)) |
| [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) | 8 | 2 | I ([Tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29)) |
| [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29) | 4 | 1 | V ([Dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_%28music%29)) |
| [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) | 4 | 1 | IV ([Subdominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdominant)) |
| [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) | 8 (inc. [Turnaround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround)) | 2 (inc. [Turnaround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround)) | I ([Tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29)) (inc. [Turnaround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround)) |

If you practise with passion then very soon you will find yourself following this structure without even thinking about it. Listen to a few well-played [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues) tunes and see if you can follow the beat and spot the places where the [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) changes occur. After a while it will seem like second nature.

## Turnaround and Introduction

Many [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) tunes end each [verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_%28music%29) with a [turnaround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround): this is basically a few [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28music%29) worth (usually two to four) of the [dominant chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_chord) (V) at the very end of a [verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_%28music%29) intended to build tension and give a clear warning that the next [twelve-bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) is about to start. Have a listen to some classic tunes and you will likely hear [turnarounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround) in each of them.

Less common (but still reasonably popular) is the [introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_%28music%29): this is usually a short [chord structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_structure) (usually two or four [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) long) designed to launch the musicians into the main [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) part of the tune. There are two main types of Introduction: the first is two [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) long and is identical to the last two [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) of the [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) (i.e. two [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) of the [tonic chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_chord) including a [turnaround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround)); the second is four [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) long and is identical to the last four [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) of the [twelve-bar Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues) (i.e. one [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) of the [dominant chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_chord), one [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) of the [subdominant chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdominant_chord), and two [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_%28music%29) of the [tonic chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_chord) including a [turnaround](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_turnaround)). [Introductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_%28music%29) are usually less of a worry to a harmonica player, because they are generally not expected to provide the lead-in to a tune. Plus, it is much easier to join in a tune once you have the [rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm) in your head.
