Now we can get into the real beef of harmonica music theory: [harmonica positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) are the most obscure part of harmonica music theory because they embody a concept that is rarely discussed.

## What are Positions?

[Harmonica positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) are basically how harmonica players can play different scales on a single harmonica. To explain: when playing a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica, the tuning is designed to allow as much versatility as possible, including many different [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)).

![C Harmonica](/assets/images/harmonicas/c_harmonica.png)

The lowest [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) (1 blow) is a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) and the highest [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) (10 blow) is also a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29). According to the original [Richter tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_tuning) such a harmonica would be described as being tuned in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale). As a result the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) is very easy to play practically all the way along from holes 1 to 10; we can describe the note of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) as being the natural [tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29) (i.e. [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28music%29) I).

So what if we wanted to play a tune in some other [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) (for example in [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29))? Well, we would have to make sure we started and finished all the [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) we played on the note of [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) (2 draw, 3 blow, 6 blow, and 9 blow) and also play some [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29). The [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) of [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) would become the new focal centre of our music: the new [tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29). In order to play the [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale) on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica we would have to use a completely different set of holes compared to the holes we would use to play the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale). That is to say, we would have to change [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions).

So, a [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) (in harmonica theory) is essentially just a particular way of playing music in a different [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) relative to the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of the harmonica you are using. Playing music in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica is called _1st Position_ (also called _Straight Harp_). To play music in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica is called _2nd Position_ (also called _Cross Harp_).

## Why are Positions so important?

To explain why [harmonica position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) are so important, it is necessary to illustrate a fundamental difference between playing a harmonica and playing an instrument like a keyboard: when playing  a keyboard we always use different keys to play different [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale); however, when you press a key on a keyboard you already know what sound is going to be produced because each key is only ever tuned to play one (and only one) particular [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note).

![Keyboard](/assets/images/harmonicas/keyboard.png)

To a certain extent, this is also true with harmonicas: if you blow on hole 4 on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica you know you are going to play a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29); if you draw on hole 2 on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica you know you are going to play a [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29), etc. However, this all changes once you decide to not use a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica; what if you are using an [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) harmonica?

![F Harmonica](/assets/images/harmonicas/f_harmonica.png)

Clearly, all the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) on an [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) harmonica are completely different. If you look carefully, you will notice that in order to play any [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) you would have to play in _2nd Position_ (or _Cross Harp_); this is because the holes that all played [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) on the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica (2 draw, 3 blow, 6 blow, and 9 blow) now all play [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) on the [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) harmonica.

This is the fundamental difference with respect to playing music on a harmonica: in order to play music in a particular [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) on a harmonica, you would need to play in a different [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) depending on the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of the harmonica itself; and since there are 12 different [keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) ([A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), [Bb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28musical_note%29), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), [Db](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%E2%99%AD_%28musical_note%29), etc.) there are (in theory) 12 different [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) on a single harmonica. If all harmonicas were tuned like a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica then there would be no distinction between a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) and a [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions); but there are, in fact, 12 different tunings (one for each [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29)), which means that the only thing that remains constant between the different tunings is the series of holes you use to play a particular [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions).

For example, to play _1st Position_ (_Straight Harp_) on an [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) harmonica you would use exactly the same holes as you would use to play _1st Position_ on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica. However, you would produce two different [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) ([F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) respectively). In order to play _2nd Position_ (_Cross Harp_) on an [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_%28musical_note%29) harmonica you would use exactly the same holes as you would use to play _2nd Position_ on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica. However (again), you would produce two different [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) and [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29) respectively).

## Do we only need one harmonica?

Since it is theoretically possible to play in any [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) on any given harmonica, the first natural assumption is that you only need one harmonica in order to play any piece of music; however, this is not the case.

There are many reasons why you would want to use a harmonica tuned to a particular [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) for a given piece of music; however, there are two main reasons that justify the need on their own:

1. A diatonic harmonica covers 3 [octaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) (37 [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) between 1 blow to 10 blow); however, there are only 10 holes on a diatonic harmonica, which offers a total of just 20 different [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) (and two of those are identical: 2 draw and 3 blow). So, overall there are only 19 different [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) built into a harmonica, which is just over half the available total. As a result, it is necessary to bend [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) in order to achieve variation (see the [Resources]({% link _harmonicas/13-resources.md %}) section for an [excellent instructional reference](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0918321115) by [David Harp](https://www.davidharp.com)). This does not change the fact the number of [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) available on a harmonica are extremely limited compared to an instrument such as a keyboard. Unless you can blow and draw on different holes at the same time, in which case there are fortunes for you to be made elsewhere (I assure you).
1. Certain styles of music sound better in particular [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) because specific sets of notes are more readily available. For example: folk and classical music sound better in _1st Position_ (as [Herr Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_tuning) designed it); [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues), Rock, and Country all sound best in _2nd Position_; _3rd_ and _4th Position_ both produce [minor music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale); _5th Position_ has a very Spanish feel to it, and is very popular in Andalusian music (as mentioned in [Advanced Scales]({% link _harmonicas/06-advanced-scales.md %})).

In fact, 90% of all [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues) music is played in _2nd Position_ because all the necessary [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale) and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28music%29) are perfectly positioned (as mentioned in [Twelve-Bar Blues]({% link _harmonicas/10-twelve-bar-blues.md %})). Similarly, _4th Position_ has its [tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29) on the [relative minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_minor) of the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of the harmonica: so on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica you would be playing music in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29); and because a [relative minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_minor) contains the same notes as its [relative major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_major), any music played in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica will sound [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale).

## How do we work out Positions?

You are unlikely to ever use more than the first five [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions); in fact, most harmonica players rarely use anything other than _1st_, _2nd_ and _4th Positions_. That said, it is still nice to understand how everything comes together. In a later section, showing [various harmonica scales]({% link _harmonicas/12-scale-charts.md %}), only the first five [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) are covered; however, these are substantial and include the [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale), [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_scale) and [pentatonic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale). The latter being very popular in Country music.

In order to calculate the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of a particular [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions), you merely count up a [perfect 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth) (7 [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone)) from the [tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29) of the previous [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions). For example, _1st Position_ on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica is in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29), so in order to work out the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of the _2nd Position_ we just count up 7 [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29): this takes us up to [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29). Likewise, to calculate the key of _3rd Position_ on a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29) harmonica we just count up another 7 [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) from [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_%28musical_note%29): this takes us up to [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29).

![Keyboard](/assets/images/harmonicas/keyboard.png)

You can also apply this logic in reverse, which is probably what you are more likely to do in practice. For example, if you want to play _2nd Position_ [Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues) in the key of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29) then you just count down 7 [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone) from [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29): this takes you down to [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29). So, in order to play _2nd Position_ in the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28musical_note%29), you would need to use a [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28musical_note%29) harmonica.

Below is a reference table that lists all the [keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) of all the [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) for all the standard harmonica [Richter tunings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_tuning). As mentioned above, you will probably never need any [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica_techniques#Positions) beyond the first five, so those should be your main focus. If you want to make your life easier when performing, then the best thing to do would be to try and remember the [keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29) translations for _2nd_ and _4th Positions_. Though sooner or later, with regular practice, these should become second nature to you.

## And finally...

So, there you have it. You now know more about harmonica music theory than around 95% of all amateur (and a fair few professional) harmonica players. Give yourself a big round of applause or a pat on the back (which ever is easier), because you have come a long way very quickly. Well done!
