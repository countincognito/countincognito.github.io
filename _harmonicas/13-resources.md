These are (in no particular order) the harmonica resources that I have found most useful when teaching myself to play:

* [Jon Gindick](https://gindick.myshopify.com): a good online resource and some decent books available too
* [Harmonica Lessons](https://www.harmonicalessons.com): the most comprehensive online resource that I know
* [David Harp](https://www.davidharp.com) references - my favourite author for beginners:
  * ["Blues & Rock Harp Positions Made Easy"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0918321832) (ISBN: 0918321832): an excellent book for explaining the principle of harmonica positions at a great price
  * ["Bending The Blues"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0918321115) (ISBN: 0918321115): another excellent book at a great price; this one helps you learn note bending - perhaps the most important harmonica technique
* [David Barrett](https://www.bluesharmonica.com/about_dave) references: my favourite author for intermediate and advanced. This is perhaps the most comprehensive source of written and recorded material available to the self-teaching harmonica player
* [Adam Gussow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gussow) references - a wonderful teacher, scholar, performer and all-round nice guy, Prof. Gussow provides many tutorials and tips for free, as well as high-quality paid resources:
  * [Adam Gussow's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KudzuRunner)
  * [Modern Blues Harmonica](https://www.modernbluesharmonica.com)
* [The Harp Handbook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0711949190) (ISBN: 0711949190) by Steve Baker: often touted as "the harmonica player's bible", and with good reason
* [Lee Oskar](https://www.leeoskar.com): my favourite harmonicas; smooth, sturdy, comfortable, modular and well-priced with great tone
