I am a Software Developer and Principal Architect for [DoctorLink](https://www.doctorlink.com) in London, UK. I love [Open Source](https://opensource.org/)/[Free](https://www.gnu.org/) software, [DotNet](https://www.microsoft.com/net/), [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/), Blues music, extreme chili sauces, and hats.

I occasionally give talks or run workshops on topics such as Software Development Process, Microservices, Agile Architecture, etc.

Every now and again I also set fire to things under the pretense of doing science demonstrations at local schools.
