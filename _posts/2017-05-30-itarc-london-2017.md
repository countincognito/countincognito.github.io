Last week I had the privilege of presenting at [Iasa ITARC](https://www.iasaglobal.org/itarc-london-may/) on my thoughts surrounding the future of software architecture and the role of the "Software Architect".

The slides from the talk can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/countincognito/future-role-of-the-architect).
