Just before Christmas I gave a presentation at the [London .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/London-NET-User-Group/) on neurodiversity in the technology industry. It was quite a difficult subject for me to talk about, which unfortunately comes across in my obvious nervousness, but I am very grateful to [Dylan Beattie](https://www.dylanbeattie.net/) (and the whole of the LDNUG) for encouraging me to go through with it.

I am not sure how much I will be talking about this sort of thing in the future, but I am glad to have gone through with it at least once.
